Notes @nathanin

- Can we start a roadmap document and eventually repurpose it as documentation?

e.g.

Milestone 1: 
Codex object

Codex(path, ...)
path: ....

Methods:
  __init__(path):
  Initialization of the Codex object should read metadata from the supplied path and run preprocessing by default.
  populate object attributes with the metadata that is read

  save(path):
  Write object to a file

  ... etc.
